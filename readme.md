# SwarmSlam

Developing Multi Robot SLAM using Swarm Robot Principles.

## Getting Started

1. Two robot with global communication
2. Two robot with local communication
    
    1. nav2d
    2. setting up

3. Many robots with local communiation

### Prerequisites

nav2d

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

the following code can be useful for two robot gloabl communication

rosservice call /robot_0/StartMapping 

/Wait for it to finish/

rosservice call /robot_0/StartExploration 

and then you can start mapping with the second robot with

rostopic pub /robot_1/Localize/goal nav2d_navigator/LocalizeActionGoal "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
goal_id:
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  id: ''
goal:
  velocity: 0.5"

rosservice call /robot_0/StartExploration
